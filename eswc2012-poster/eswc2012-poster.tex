%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present, classify, and discuss ranking criteria for
pruning event-related media items stemming from multiple social networks.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Mobile devices like smartphones, together with social networks,
enable people to create, share, and consume media items
like videos or images.
They accompany their owners almost everywhere they may go
and are thus omnipresent at all sorts of events.
Given a~stable network connection, event-related media items and microposts are published
on social networks both during events and afterwards.
Ranked media items stemming from multiple social networks
can serve to create authentic media galleries
that illustrate events and their atmosphere.
A~key feature for this task is the semantic enrichment of media items and associated microposts.

\section{Motivational Event Scenarios}
We assume (and are working on) media item extractors
that, given event-related search terms,
extract raw binary media items and associated microposts from multiple social networks.
Events like concerts, sports matches, or keynotes
are typically well covered social-media-wise.
The given contexts of known artists, sports teams, or speakers
allow for leveraging knowledge from the
Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud\footnote{Linked Open Data cloud: \url{http://lod-cloud.net/}}.
For example, a~video of the former German President \emph{Christian Wulff}
that gets shared on social networks and that can be found via the search term \emph{``wulff''}
is considered more relevant for the---at time of writing---recent
event of his resignation speech,
if (i)~in the accompanying microposts, the named entity represented by the DBpedia concept
\url{db:Resignation_speech} is detected,
and (ii)~his face is recognized in the video.
In the example, this video might outrank a~video
of a journalist commenting on the case.
We note, however, that many more ranking criteria exist,
which we will talk about in the next Section.

\section{Classification and Discussion of Ranking Criteria}
\textbf{Visual}
This category regards the actual contents of media items.
We distinguish \emph{low-level} and \emph{high-level} visual ranking criteria.
Examples for high-level ranking criteria are the detection of logos,
the recognition of faces, or the separation in camera shots.
Examples for low-level ranking criteria are file size, pixel resolution,
video duration, geolocation, date and time information, etc.

\noindent \textbf{Textual}
This category regards the microposts that accompany media items.
Typically, microposts provide a~description of media items.
Using named entity disambiguation tools,
textual content can be linked to LOD cloud concepts~\cite{Facebook2011}.

\noindent \textbf{Social}
This category regards social network effects like shares, mentions,
number of views, expressions of (dis)likes, user diversity, etc.
Our previous work allows us to not only examine these effects
on a~\emph{single} social network (\emph{e.g.}, ReTweets on Twitter),
but in a~\emph{network-agnostic} way across multiple social networks.

\noindent \textbf{Aesthetic}
This category regards the desired outcome after the ranking, \emph{i.e.},
the media gallery that illustrates an event and its atmosphere.
Studies exist for the aesthetics of
automatic photo book layout~\cite{Photo2011}
and photo aesthetics \emph{per se}~\cite{Photo2012},
but media gallery composition requires mixing video \emph{and} image media items.\\

\noindent We have run first media item ranking tests for combinations
of ranking criteria and ranking criteria in isolation.
For some ranking criteria, preferences are straightforward
(\emph{e.g.}, high pixel resolution is preferred over low resolution,
more views over less, etc.).
For others, preferences are less clear (\emph{e.g.}, video duration).

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
The contribution of this paper is the groundwork of classifying ranking criteria
and their compilation in the first place.
Future work will focus on user studies to determine weight factors
for different ranking criteria.
Therefore, we will implement an interactive application,
where users will be asked to adjust ranking criteria weights
for different events via sliders, to agree on a common ranking.
